# INTRO

This is a simple educational script for classifying brain graphs.
It comprises graph preprocessing, feature
extraction, feature selection, cross-validation, training, testing,
classifier selection, and information mapping.

See paper <http://www.richiardi.net/papers/2013-Richiardi-IEEESigProcMag.pdf>
for the larger context.

It will not provide state of the art performance, but can be used as an
exploratory basis for your own work. Apart from modern embeddings, kernels
and graph CNNs, it lacks nested cross-validation for classifier parameter
setting and projection dimension in feature selection. 

Your entrypoint is `graphClassification_cheap.m`
